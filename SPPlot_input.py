### SPPlot follows a 'simple' routine. It read in your visibilities, stores them in
# numpy arrays, and plots the data on 3D plot of frequency x time x amplitude/phase.

# FIRST - if chosen, it will read in one or more flag tables and dump these out as
# numpy arrays (load_in_flags function originally written by Danielle Fenech).
# SECOND - it will append the visibilities into arrays (per IF, per baseline, per stokes,
# per timeperpage) but saving these straight to the hard disk by the use of PyTables,
# this is in order to be memory inexpensive
# THIRD - it will read in the numpy arrays in parrallel, collating each IF together
# into an array fit for one spplot page, and physically spplot each page using matlibplot
# routines within the makespplot function.
# FOURTH - it merges all the pages into one .pdf file and/or creates a single 'combined'
# plot that includes each baseline on one page. There is one combined plot for every
# timeperage/parallel and cross hands

### This program can be run on both single and multi source files and you may select
# the sources you wish to plot (it will plot them all in time order).

### Plotting Options:

                                          # logarithmically ('log') or min/max within 3 std of mean ('std') -
                                          # a log scale may show greater detail if the differences in min and max
                                          # amplitudes are very large. If 'std' is chosen, the max and min amplitudes
                                          # will be taken to be the mean +/- three stand deviations.

scale_over_all_IFs = 'yes'	                # Choosing to scale over all IFs gives a true representation of your data
                                          # but since RFI can vary severly from IF to IF it is likely that your plots
                                          # will show less detail for those IFs less affected by RFI. If 'no' the
                                          # program will scale each IF individually according to their own maximum
                                          # and minimum amplitudes - this will give a good indication of RFI within
                                          # individual IFs but note that the colorbar scale will correspond only to
                                          # the last IF. Underneath each IF there is a min and max amplitude value
                                          # for each IF - this will give you an idea of the differences between each
